## Requirements

#### Textual Analysis 

<details><summary> </summary>

![textual analysis](/Documents/textual_team10.png)

##### Questions and Assumptions
 
- Q1: Who is the user? 
<br><br>
- A1 relates to Q1: researchers, students, professors will be the target users of this web app 
- A2: the tools will be linked to eachother, so they can be used simultaneously 

</details>

#### Use Case 

<details><summary> </summary>

![use case](/Documents/usecase_team10.png)

The use case is brief as there is not any communication between users through the app, there is one user and the web app provides everything the user needs. We chose to build this diagram to help visualise what tools we would need to build and what the end goal of these tools uses are. We can now clearly see the 3 tools that will work together to acheive showing how use of colour has developed over time in data visualisation. 

##### Questions and Assumptions: 

- Q1: is there only 1 single goal all users would like to acheive? 
- Q2: is the annotation tool done byy the web app using colour recognition or manually by the user?
<br><br>
- A1: the tools will be linked to eachother, so they can be used simultaneously and they use eachothers data collected to perform
- A2 relates to Q1 : all users have the same goal and experience with the web app 
- A3 relates to Q2: the user manually annotates images using the tool we provide

#### Personas + User Stories

<details><summary> </summary>


| Persona | Photo | Name | Job Title | Demographics | Goals and Tasks | Environment | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Jamie - biology undergrad student who has general interest in use of colour | <img src="/Documents/Isaac.jpg" width=350 height=250> | Isaac Jordan | Second Year Biology Student | - 20 years old<br> - Born in South East England, moved further north for university<br> - Studied Biology, Physics and History at A-Level with good grades in all three | Isaac is interested in discovering more about data visualisation and its evolution, especially since he wants to do well in his dissertation next year. He thinks understanding data visualisation in more depth will help him achieve this and allow him to represent concepts and key points in a clear and concise manner. He also finds the field intriguing simply due to its relevance and relationship with the sciences and other subjects that he enjoys the most. | Has lots of experience with interpreting and creating graphs and charts, but mostly by hand and not as much with technology. However, he is comfortable using technology for everyday things like social media and instant messaging. Might struggle with learning software unless it has a simplistic and intuitive UI. | 
| Yizhan - elderly researcher who is used to doing work. manually not with computer | | | | | | | 
| Sellena - professor who is profficient with technology| | | | | | | 
| Luke - phd student Lobert| | | | | | | 
| Zhening - someone who attends use of colour conferences | | | | | | | 
| Undergraduate Data Analytics Student at LSE  | ![persona photo](/Documents/Maya.png) | Maya Gomez | International First Year Student | - 18 years old <br> - Moved to UK for university<br> - has interest in economics and data analytics  | is very new to the subject and is not so sure of how interested they are in it. Wants to acheive good grades in the use of colour for data visualisation module. | Is skilled when it comes to technology including building graphs. Can pickup new software quite quickly as long as there is a manual or guidance. |

##### User - Maya Gomez : 


| Requirement | Acceptance Criteria | Priority | 
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ----- |
| As a student , I want a user manual so that I can understand how to use the software and keep up with my course and can learn how to use the tools as quickly as possible | The web tools should have an explanation section on how they are used | 1 | 
| As an new to the subject student, I want the tools to have a simple interface so that I can focus on the content I am trying to learn rather than figuring out the web app | The web app should have a simplified to look to it so as to not scare the students and have them thinking its complicated. Clear and simple images can be used instead of long messy looking words, that they can clic on when using the tools  | 2 | 
| As a student taking the use of colour for data visulisation module, I want to be able to build an aesthetically pleasing graph from the data i collect through annotating so that I can submit it for my coursework and get a good grade| the tool that allows a user to explore the colour properties over time can be a graph option | 1 | 


<br>
We decided to use personas and user stories as part of our requirements gathering as it helped visualise a way in which different people, of different inent and technological ability would be able to utilise the web app. Although the app is made for 3 distinct tasks contributing to 1 end goal, it was essential for us to see how to incorparate different levels of skill to make a coherent interface suitable for all users. As use of colour is a niche topic, you might assume that people using the web app would not need much simplification added to it as these people would already be skilled in this topic, however there are not many tools that are like our web app for these people to use so it is something new. Furthermore, even those with wide knowledge on the subject, may not have technological logic and there are people who are new to the topic that we have to consider, so therefore personas and user stories allow us to take these viewpoints into account.

##### Questions and Assumptions:

- Q1: can this web app be used together with a university course module?
